This project was created using Nextjs, Neon Postgres db, tailwind CSS, and some libraries including next-auth. 

Once you go on the website, you can scroll to read the instructions, but you sign up or sign in. Once you are logged in, you can make Haikus and post them to the gallery. If you do not have an account, you can view the gallery but cannot post. Some features coming out later included the AI generation of haikus based on topics and someone you can add an image to so your haiku can have it as a background.
